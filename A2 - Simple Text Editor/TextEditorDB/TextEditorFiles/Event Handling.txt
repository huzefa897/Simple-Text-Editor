Event Handling

• Graphical User Interface’s (GUIs) are event driven
• All controls have events associated with them.
• Examples of events would include mouse and keyboard handling. Controls
being moved and resized. Controls being created and closed.
• Events are user actions such as key press, clicks, mouse movements, etc.,
or some occurrence such as system generated notifications.
• Applications need to respond to events when they occur. For example,
interrupts. Events are used for inter-process communication.
• Click in the Properties Window of a Control to create the required event
handler. The generates handler will be in the form
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
